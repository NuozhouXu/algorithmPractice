Number of substrings in a string: n * (n + 1) / 2  O(n^2)
Number of subsequences of a string: For each character, it is either in the subsequence or not, thus O(2^n)

Number of permutations of a list of elements: n!
n choose r permutation n! / (n âˆ’ r)!

Number of combinations of a list of elements: 
n choose r combinations n! / r!(n - r)!

Number of subsets of a list of elements: 2^n
