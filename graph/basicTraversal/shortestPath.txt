BFS works for finding shortest path for unweighted graphs

Single source shortest path problems:
Variants
1. Single destination: find a shortest path to a given destination vertex t from each vertex v. Reverse the direciton of the graph.
2. Single pair: Find a shortest path from u to v for given vertices u and v. 
3. All pairs: Find a shortest path from u to v for every pairs of vertices u and v.

Properties:
1. shortest path cannot have negative cycles
2. shortest path cannot have cycles in general
3. no negative edge can be reached from the source
